# What is .ipynb_checkpoints

The `.ipynb_checkpoints/` directory is automatically created by Jupyter Notebooks to store checkpoint files. These checkpoint files are used to save the state of your Jupyter Notebook at various points while you are working on it. This allows you to recover your work in case of an unexpected interruption, such as a kernel restart or a crash.

Here's a brief explanation of the components:

- **.ipynb_checkpoints/:** This directory contains checkpoint files for your Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook you work on will have a corresponding checkpoint file in this directory.

When you see the `.ipynb_checkpoints/` directory as an untracked file in your Git repository, it means that Git has detected this directory but it is not being tracked by your repository yet. It's common practice to exclude this directory from version control because it contains auto-generated files that can be easily regenerated from the main Jupyter Notebook file.

You can add the `.ipynb_checkpoints/` directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git. This is a good practice to avoid unnecessary changes in your version control system related to Jupyter Notebook checkpoints.

For example, you can add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```plaintext
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

This will instruct Git to ignore any files or directories named `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.

After updating your `.gitignore` file, you can commit the changes to your repository:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude .ipynb_checkpoints/"
```

This way, you avoid tracking auto-generated files and focus on versioning your actual work and source code.
