# Infering Rudimentary Rules

## 1R (1-Rule)

- **1R** is a simple algorithm that uses a single rule to classify the data. It is a very simple algorithm that is used to classify the data based on a single rule. It is also known as **One Rule** algorithm.

### How 1R Works

- The 1R algorithm works by selecting a single attribute and a single value of that attribute to make predictions. It selects the attribute that gives the best accuracy on the training data and uses it to make predictions on new data.

- The 1R algorithm works as follows:

  1. For each attribute, the algorithm calculates the error rate of the rule that uses that attribute to make predictions.
  2. The algorithm selects the attribute that gives the lowest error rate and uses it to make predictions.
  3. The algorithm uses the selected attribute to make predictions on new data.

- The 1R algorithm is very simple and easy to understand, but it is not very accurate. It is often used as a baseline algorithm to compare the performance of more complex algorithms.

### Example of 1R

- Let's consider an example to understand how the 1R algorithm works. Suppose we have a dataset that contains information about the weather and whether people went outside or not. The dataset contains the following attributes:

  - Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy
  - Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool
  - Humidity: High, Normal
  - Windy: True, False

- The goal is to predict whether people will go outside based on the weather conditions. The 1R algorithm works as follows:

    1. For each attribute, the algorithm calculates the error rate of the rule that uses that attribute to make predictions.
    2. The algorithm selects the attribute that gives the lowest error rate and uses it to make predictions.
    3. The algorithm uses the selected attribute to make predictions on new data.

- The 1R algorithm selects the attribute that gives the lowest error rate and uses it to make predictions. For example, if the algorithm finds that the attribute "Outlook" gives the lowest error rate, it will use the rule "If Outlook = Sunny, then people will go outside" to make predictions.

## RIPPER (Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction)

- **RIPPER** is a rule-based classification algorithm that is used to classify the data based on a set of rules. It is an extension of the 1R algorithm and is used to generate a set of rules that can be used to classify the data.

### How RIPPER Works

- The RIPPER algorithm works by generating a set of rules that can be used to classify the data. It uses a process of repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction to generate a set of rules that are accurate and easy to understand.

- The RIPPER algorithm works as follows:

  1. The algorithm starts with an empty set of rules.
  2. The algorithm selects an attribute and a value of that attribute to create a rule.
  3. The algorithm uses the rule to classify the data and calculates the error rate of the rule.
  4. The algorithm prunes the rule to reduce the error rate and adds it to the set of rules.
  5. The algorithm repeats steps 2-4 until it has generated a set of rules that are accurate and easy to understand.

- The RIPPER algorithm is more complex than the 1R algorithm, but it is more accurate and can generate a set of rules that are easy to understand.

### Example of RIPPER

- Let's consider an example to understand how the RIPPER algorithm works. Suppose we have a dataset that contains information about the weather and whether people went outside or not. The dataset contains the following attributes:

  - Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy
  - Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool
  - Humidity: High, Normal
  - Windy: True, False

- The goal is to predict whether people will go outside based on the weather conditions. The RIPPER algorithm works as follows:

    1. The algorithm starts with an empty set of rules.
    2. The algorithm selects an attribute and a value of that attribute to create a rule.
    3. The algorithm uses the rule to classify the data and calculates the error rate of the rule.
    4. The algorithm prunes the rule to reduce the error rate and adds it to the set of rules.
    5. The algorithm repeats steps 2-4 until it has generated a set of rules that are accurate and easy to understand.

- The RIPPER algorithm generates a set of rules that can be used to classify the data. For example, it might generate the following rules:

  - If Outlook = Sunny and Humidity = High, then people will not go outside
  - If Outlook = Overcast, then people will go outside
  - If Outlook = Rainy and Windy = True, then people will not go outside

## CN2 (Classiﬁcation by Naïve Bayes)

- **CN2** is a rule-based classification algorithm that is used to classify the data based on a set of rules. It is an extension of the RIPPER algorithm and is used to generate a set of rules that can be used to classify the data.

### How CN2 Works

- The CN2 algorithm works by generating a set of rules that can be used to classify the data. It uses a process of repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction to generate a set of rules that are accurate and easy to understand.

- The CN2 algorithm works as follows:

  1. The algorithm starts with an empty set of rules.
  2. The algorithm selects an attribute and a value of that attribute to create a rule.
  3. The algorithm uses the rule to classify the data and calculates the error rate of the rule.
  4. The algorithm prunes the rule to reduce the error rate and adds it to the set of rules.
  5. The algorithm repeats steps 2-4 until it has generated a set of rules that are accurate and easy to understand.

- The CN2 algorithm is more complex than the RIPPER algorithm, but it is more accurate and can generate a set of rules that are easy to understand.

### Example of CN2

  - Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy
  - Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool
  - Humidity: High, Normal
  - Windy: True, False

- The CN2 algorithm generates a set of rules that can be used to classify the data. For example, it might generate the following rules:

  - If Outlook = Sunny and Humidity = High, then people will not go outside
  - If Outlook = Overcast, then people will go outside
  - If Outlook = Rainy and Windy = True, then people will not go outside

## Conclusion

- In this article, we explored the 1R, RIPPER, and CN2 algorithms, which are used to classify the data based on a set of rules. These algorithms are simple and easy to understand, but they are not very accurate. They are often used as baseline algorithms to compare the performance of more complex algorithms.
