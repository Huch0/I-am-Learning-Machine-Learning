# Laplace Correction

## Introduction

- **Laplace correction** (or add-one smoothing) is a technique used to smooth the probability estimates of features in a **naive Bayes classifier**.
- It is used to address the problem of **zero-frequency** (i.e., when a feature does not occur in a particular class) in the training data.
- Laplace correction adds a small count to the frequency of each feature to ensure that no feature has a zero probability of occurrence in any class.

## How Laplace Correction Works

- Laplace correction works by adding a small count to the frequency of each feature in the training data.
- It is based on the assumption that each feature has a small probability of occurrence in any class, even if it has not been observed in the training data.

- The formula for Laplace correction is given by:

  $$P(x_i|y) = \frac{N_{x_i, y} + 1}{N_y + |V|}$$

  where:
  - $P(x_i|y)$ is the probability of feature $x_i$ occurring in class $y$.
  - $N_{x_i, y}$ is the frequency of feature $x_i$ in class $y$.
  - $N_y$ is the total count of features in class $y$.
  - $|V|$ is the size of the vocabulary (i.e., the total number of unique features).

- The term $N_{x_i, y} + 1$ in the numerator represents the count of feature $x_i$ in class $y$ plus one (the Laplace correction).
- The term $N_y + |V|$ in the denominator represents the total count of features in class $y$ plus the size of the vocabulary.

- Laplace correction ensures that no feature has a zero probability of occurrence in any class, even if it has not been observed in the training data.
