# Association Rules

## Introduction

- **Association rules** are a type of rule-based model used to discover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.
- They are widely used for **market basket analysis**, **recommendation systems**, and **cross-marketing**.
- Association rules capture **frequent itemsets** and **correlations** between items in transactional data.

## Key Concepts

- **Support**:
  - The support of a rule measures the frequency of occurrence of the antecedent and consequent items in the dataset.
  - It is calculated as the proportion of transactions that contain both the antecedent and consequent items.
    - Support(A) = (Transactions containing A) / (Total transactions)

- **Confidence**:
  - The confidence of a rule measures the conditional probability of the consequent item given the antecedent items.
  - It is calculated as the proportion of transactions containing the antecedent items that also contain the consequent item.
    - Confidence(A -> B) = (Transactions containing both A and B) / (Transactions containing A)

- **Lift**:
  - The lift of a rule measures the strength of the association between the antecedent and consequent items.
  - It is calculated as the ratio of the observed support to the expected support under statistical independence.
    - Lift(A -> B) = Support(A, B) / (Support(A) * Support(B))

- **Frequent Itemsets**:
  - Frequent itemsets are sets of items that occur together with a frequency above a specified threshold.
  - They are used to generate association rules that capture interesting relationships between items.

## Algorithms

- **Apriori**:
  - The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used to mine association rules from transactional data.
  - It uses a level-wise search strategy to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

- **FP-Growth**:
  - The FP-Growth algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to mine association rules from transactional data.
  - It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
