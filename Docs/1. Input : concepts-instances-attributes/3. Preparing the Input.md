# Preparing the Input

## Introduction

Data preparation is a critical step in the **machine learning process**, ensuring that raw data is transformed into a suitable format for modeling. It bridges the gap between data collection and model training.

## Data Preparation Process

1. **Select Data**:
    - Choose a subset of available data for your problem.
    - Consider what data is necessary to address your specific question or task.
    - Record assumptions about the data you need.
    - Questions to guide this step:
        - What data is available (extent, sources)?
        - What data is missing but desired (unrecorded or unrecordable)?
        - What data can be excluded (not relevant)?

2. **Preprocess Data**:
    - Get the selected data into a usable form:
        - **Formatting**: Convert data to a consistent format (e.g., from a relational database to a flat file).
        - **Data Cleansing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
        - **Sampling**: Select a representative subset if the data is large.
    - Address issues like:
        - Duplicate records.
        - Inconsistent units or scales.
        - Incorrect data types.

3. **Data Transformation**:
    - Prepare features for modeling:
        - **Feature engineering**: Create new features from existing ones (e.g., extracting day of the week from a timestamp).
        - **Scaling**: Normalize features to a common scale (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization).
        - **Encoding**: Convert categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
        - **Dimensionality reduction**: Reduce the number of features (e.g., using PCA).
    - Ensure the target variable is appropriately formatted.

## Importance of Data Preparation

- **Quality**: Well-prepared data leads to better model performance.
- **Consistency**: Consistent handling of data ensures reproducibility.
- **Efficiency**: Properly formatted data speeds up model training.
- **Generalization**: Models learn patterns from clean, relevant data.
