# What's in an Attribute?

## Definition

- An attribute represents a **feature**, **field**, or **variable** that describes an object, individual, or phenomenon.
- Attributes serve as the input variables used for training machine learning models.
- Each data instance (observation) consists of multiple attributes.

## Types of Attributes

- **Qualitative(Nominal, Binary) Attributes**:
  - Represent distinct categories or classes.
  - Examples: Colors (red, blue, green), types (car, bike, bus), labels (spam, not spam).
- **Quantitative(Numeric) Attributes**:
  - Take on numerical values that can be measured or counted.
  - Examples: Height (in centimeters), weight (in kilograms), temperature (in degrees Celsius).

## Role in Machine Learning

- Attributes are essential for building predictive models.
- They influence the model's predictions and capture relevant information from the data.
- Properly selecting and preprocessing attributes is crucial for model performance.

## Example

- Consider a dataset of house prices:
  - Attributes: Square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, age of the house.
  - Target: House price (the value we want to predict).
