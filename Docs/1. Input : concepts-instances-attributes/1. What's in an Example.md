# What's in an Example?

## Definition

- An example represents a single data point with associated features (input variables) and a corresponding target (output variable).
- Examples are essential for teaching machine learning models to learn patterns and make predictions.

## Types of Examples

- **Training Examples**:
  - Used during model training.
  - Consist of input features and known target values.
  - The model learns from these examples to generalize patterns.
- **Validation Examples**:
  - Used to fine-tune model hyperparameters.
  - Helps prevent overfitting.
- **Test Examples**:
  - Used to evaluate model performance.
  - Unseen data with unknown targets.

## Example Formats

- **Structured Data Examples**:
  - Represented as rows in a table or dataframe.
  - Each column corresponds to a feature.
- **Textual Examples**:
  - Sentences, paragraphs, or documents.
  - Features extracted from text (e.g., bag-of-words, embeddings).

## Example Use Cases

- **Image Classification**:
  - Examples: Images of cats, dogs, cars, etc.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - Examples: Sentences, reviews, tweets.
- **Time Series Forecasting**:
  - Examples: Historical stock prices, weather data.
