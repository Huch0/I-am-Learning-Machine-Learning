# I-am-Learning-Machine-Learning

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my learning journey in the field of Machine Learning. I will be updating this repository with the resources I am using to learn and the projects I am working on.

Most of the contents were written with the help of below resources and LLMs such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.

Especially, most of the code examples were of great help to this book: [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413) by Andreas C. Müller, Sarah Guido.
